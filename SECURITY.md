## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, we advise you to _not_ create an issue on GitHub for it as 
it could put all TeamCity installations using TC-Discord-Webhooks on risk. 
Please send an e-mail to [this mail][security-mail] to report such issues.

We take security issues serious and will not create an GitHub issue for any critical security issue 
until we have supplied a fix. All communication with the contributor of the issue will be held through e-mail
until we are at a point where we can release information about the issue publicly.
